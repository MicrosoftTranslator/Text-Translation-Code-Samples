# Translator API V3 - Go Samples

This repository includes Go code samples for Microsoft Translator. Each sample corresponds to a **Quickstart** activity on [doc.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/), including:

* Translating text
* Transliterating text 
* Identifying the language of source text
* Getting alternate translations
* Getting a complete list of supported languages
* Determining sentence length

[Get started with the Translator quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/quickstart-translator).

## Prerequisites

* You'll need to install the [Go distribution](https://golang.org/doc/install) in order to run this code. The sample code uses only **core** libraries, so there are no external dependencies.
* An Azure subscription - [Sign-up for a free account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/translator-text-how-to-signup)!
* A Translator resource - [Create a Translator resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextTranslation)
